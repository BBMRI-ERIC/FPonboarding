## The Provenance Platform

### What is Provenance?

Provenance is the tracking system that records what happens to samples and data throughout their lifecycle—from collection to research use to publication. It's basically an audit trail that shows who accessed what, when, and for what purpose.

Think of it as a chain of custody for biobank samples and data. It helps biobanks demonstrate impact, ensures accountability, and provides transparency for governance and compliance purposes.

**Who runs it:** BBMRI-ERIC Common Service IT maintains the platform as part of the integrated [discovery and access infrastructure](Overview.md).
