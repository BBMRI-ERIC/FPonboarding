## The Negotiator Platform

### Overview

The **Negotiator** is an online communication and negotiation tool that facilitates structured interactions between researchers and biobanks for access to biological samples, associated data, and services. It streamlines the access request workflow while ensuring transparency and compliance with ethical and legal requirements.

**Funding**: Operated and maintained by BBMRI-ERIC Common Service IT (CS IT) as part of the integrated discovery and access infrastructure.

### Architecture

Negotiator uses a **communication workflow architecture**:

#### Request Management Component
- Structured request forms capturing research requirements
- Multi-biobank request handling
- Request tracking and status management
- Integrated with BBMRI-ERIC AAI for authentication

#### Communication Component
- Secure messaging between researchers and biobank representatives
- Document exchange capabilities
- Negotiation history and audit trail
- Notification system for request updates

### How It Works

1. **Request initiation**: Researchers identify relevant biobanks through the Directory or Locator
2. **Query submission**: Users create access requests specifying:
   - Research objectives and scope
   - Sample or data requirements
   - Intended use and ethical approvals
   - Timeline and resource needs
3. **Request distribution**: The Negotiator forwards requests to relevant biobank representatives
4. **Negotiation process**: Structured communication between parties covering:
   - Feasibility assessment
   - Material Transfer Agreements (MTA)
   - Data Transfer Agreements (DTA)
   - Cost negotiations
   - Ethical and legal requirements (GDPR compliance)
5. **Agreement finalization**: Parties reach agreement on access conditions
6. **Access fulfillment**: Biobanks provide samples/data according to agreed terms

**Example workflow**: Researcher finds relevant brain tumor samples in Locator → Creates access request via Negotiator → Biobank reviews request → Parties negotiate MTA terms → Agreement reached → Samples shipped

### Workflow Integration

The Negotiator connects seamlessly with other BBMRI-ERIC tools:

- **Directory integration**: Direct request creation from biobank profiles
- **Locator integration**: Access requests initiated from federated search results
- **Standardized templates**: GDPR-compliant consent templates and DTA/MTA models
- **Transparency mechanisms**: Feedback on sample and data use for all stakeholders

### Your Responsibilities

**For Biobanks**:
- Biobank representatives act as primary contact points
- Timely response to access requests
- Providing feasibility assessments and cost estimates
- Negotiating terms within institutional and legal frameworks
- Ensuring compliance with GDPR and ethical standards
- Coordinating with institutional ethics boards and legal teams

**For Researchers**:
- Clear description of research objectives and requirements
- Providing necessary ethical approvals and documentation
- Respecting agreed terms and conditions
- Providing feedback on sample/data use where appropriate

**Communication**: The Negotiator ensures all communication is documented, traceable, and compliant with institutional policies and European regulations.
